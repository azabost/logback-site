<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<p>A mailing list is an electronic discussion forum that anyone
    can subscribe to. When someone sends an email message to the
    mailing list, a copy of that message is broadcast to everyone who
    is subscribed to that mailing list. Mailing lists provide a simple
    and effective communication mechanism. With potentially thousands
    of subscribers, there is a common set of <a
            href="http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/mailing-list-etiquette.pdf">etiquette
        guidelines</a> that you should observe.
</p>

<h3>Respect the mailing list type</h3>

<p>The "User" lists are where you can send questions and comments
    about configuration, setup, usage and other "user" types of
    questions. The "Developer" lists are where you can send questions and
    comments about the actual software source code and other issues
    related to development.
</p>

<p>Some questions are appropriate for posting on both the "user"
    and the "developer" lists. In this case, pick one and only one. Do
    not cross post.
